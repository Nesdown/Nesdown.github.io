			<div id="text">I am Bohdan, currently I'm a student on the last year at high school. Development is kinda process of creating something new for me, so I get interested in (almost) everything connected with programming and IT in common. <br/><br/>

			I began with gamedev when I was about 11 y.o. Have worked with Lua and Love2D, Unity, Gm:S. Then came to the web-backend and servlets development with the stuff like Python, Java etc. To the point, my second hobby is competitive programming and long-term development contests. I've taken part in 
			Gamiron #6 and #7 (you can find projects in Portfolio tab), some city's and country's competitions like 'IT-arena'. <br/> <br/> 

			Also, I'm a huge fan of electronics prototyping with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, so there's part of articles dedicated to them. I still create games betweentimes, and can't restrain from writing a few thoughts about it. And finally, there's a link to my GitHub profile upper so I'll be happy if you take a look at it. <br/><br/>

			If you have any questions, please contact me on newsdownloads12@gmail.com. I'm ready for your recommendations or collaboration! <br/><br/>
