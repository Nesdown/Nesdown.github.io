			<div id="headline-article-text"> Hi, my name is Bohdan Glushko. I am a software engineer.</div><br/>

			<div id="text">Currently I'm a student on the last year at high school. For me, development is kinda process of creating something new, giving a huge space for creativity. That's why I get interested in (almost) everything connected with programming and IT in common. <br/><br/>

			I began with gamedev as about 11 y.o. child. Have worked with Lua and Love2D, Unity, Gm:S. Then came to the web-backend and servlets development with the stuff like Python, Java etc. To the point, my second hobby is competitive programming and long-term development contests: I've taken part in 
			Gamiron #6 and #7, some city's and country's competitions like 'IT-arena'. <br/> <br/> 

			Also, I'm a huge fan of electronics prototyping with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, so there's part of articles dedicated to them. I still create games betweentimes, and can't restrain from writing a few thoughts about it. And finally, there's a link to my GitHub profile upper so I'll be happy if you take a look at it. </div> 

			<div id="headline-article-text"> So, what is my skills' stack?</div><br/>
			<div id="text">
			• UI development (Java Core, JavaFX)<br/>
			• Web-Backend (Python, web-scrapping technologies)<br/>
			• Servlets engineering<br/>
			• Web-design (HTML5, CSS3)<br/></div>

			<div id="headline-article-text"> Contacts</div><br/>
			<div id="text"> If you have any questions, please contact me on newsdownloads12@gmail.com, I'll try to reply ASAP. I'm opened to your recommendations or collaboration! <br/><br/>
