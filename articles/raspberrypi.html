				Raspberry Pi ideas: how, why and were
			</div>

			<div id="text">

				I've been playing around with Raspberry Pi B+ since January. Tried some different Linux distributions and made a couple of projects - so I hope that will be enough for the 'thoughts compilation' made as top-10 of the most interesting ideas for the small berry computer.
				By the way, I'm writing this post without mention what RPi is, and why you should take a look at it. But if  you haven't heard about it before, here's a wiki link. So, as always, let's get started!<br/><br/>

				<strong>10. Easy electronics experiments</strong> <br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/10.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				RPi is perfect for studying electronics cause it has 40 GPIO pins, so all you have to do is to find a breadboard, wires and start experiments! All you need for programming is Python which turns into a quite easy tool in usage for this case. Make a LED traffic light or have fun with servo? No problem!<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>9. Fancy clock</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/9.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				Don't forget that 'berry computer' has display shield, Ethernet and USB ports on the board, so you can add any functions to your clock - notifications, music player (we'll talk about music soon), a display with different watchfaces - there are lots of clock-projects, so why don't you try to bring to life your own ideas?
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>8. Digital camera</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/8.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				There are lots of 'plug'n'play' camera modules on the web stores - all you need is to put one into the Camera Interface (CSI). Now you can choose from 5- and 8MP resolutions, and I'm sure that it's not the end. By the way, there were some tries to launch mass production of RPi  cameras with modding possibility on Kickstarter. Unfortunately, the were not really successful at all.  
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>7. Beautiful art installation</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/7.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				If you wanna feel like a real artist or well-known expressionist, you probably should try to create an art installation with Raspberry Pi. Just imagine: fantastic LED forests which can change colors depending on the milieu, self-drawing pictures, real-time recursive Penrose tilings in the frames... With your 'electronic berry', any kind of art is possible! 
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>6. Personalized musical instrument</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/6.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				Pi community offers some nice decisions to make you love music and try to create some own samples. For example, it's possible to use special 'hats' that turn your mini-computer into a piano/drumset or just add some buttons and program 'em. Actually, you don't really need to worry about software - everything is already done, for  example hats' music libraries or programs like Sonic Pi, which may help you not just find out more about music but learn how-to code as well. 
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>5. Usage in science</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/5.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				It is not all about education in common. RPi is powerful enough to store, process data and even make some sort of difficult calculations. As a result, today you can see lots of interesting projects for biology, astronomy, physics etc. The 'electronic berry' can help children find the real, interesting side of the science and at the same time it can be used for the serious experiments in laboratories.
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>4. A real server</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/4.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				Sooth to say, one mini-computer is not enough for this project. It's much better to assemble kinda cluster of several RPis. But the result will give you hundreds o perspectives like storing your websites' data (hint: use Apache!), making social networks bots (I'll write an article about this issue soon), creating personal cloud storage with security system realization and lots, lots more.
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>3. Media player</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/3.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				This project is really cool and simple at the same time. You don't need expensive media player anymore! Take the Pi, install special software, connect it to the TV, make sure that you have strong Internet connection and welcome to the world of media - now you can watch videos and photos, listen to music, use web-streaming services just for 35$ (or even 5$ if you use Raspberry Pi Zero)! Also,it's possible to connect a mobile phone as a remote control and make the TV really smart.
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>2. Gaming console</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/2.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				Raspberry Pi community has already written lots of different emulators, so you can launch any old game you want - for Game Boy, MAME, Nintendo 64 or even Playstation 1. Just decide what kind of console do you want - standalone or portable and add some control elements. Some makers use old gamepads as case, some make own via 3D-printer. By the way, the console you can get is much cheaper than chinese copies of Game Boy Advance, for example.  
				<br/><br/><br/>

				<strong>1. Smart house</strong><br/><br/>
				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/1.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/>

				That's exactly the best thing you can come up to make life easier and cooler. Just put Bluetooth module on the RPi, add some sensors, lamps and everything else you want, put this system in your house and voila - you have the real smart home. Actually, 'electronic berry' is perfect for this project cause you can connect many different sensors to it, program 'em as you want and choose the connection interface like Bluetooth, IR or wired. To put your smart-system on the top of awesomeness register your Pi as an Alexa device, add a microphone and a speaker to control everything with your voice. You'll probably get an exact copy of Jarvis like in the 'Iron Man' film.<br/><br/><br/>

				<center><img class="shadow" src="../images/articles/raspberrypi/ironman.jpg" width=400px/></center><br/><br/>

				Of course, this list of projects is not full. But you can improvise, bring own cool ideas to life and find out lots new about programming, electronics, IT in common at this point. Raspberry Pi grew up from the computer for education into a serious device for prototyping, bringing thousands of different possibilities. And, obviously, it's just the beginning for the era of the cheap but powerful electronics. Stay tuned!
